[A Ruby and RSpec testing assignment from the Viking Code School](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

### Sean Luckett

**Notes**
* I added a Gemfile so RubyMine would run the tests within the IDE.
* I do all I can to avoid testing private variables/methods so I didn't use any Ruby cheats to do it. Testing through the interface is sufficient.
